This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Ada programming: incorrect use of named parameter association with a function that doesn't define named parameters.  The `bug.ada` file shows the erroneous code, which raises a `Constraint_Error` exception.  The `bugSolution.ada` file provides a corrected version with proper exception handling.
